# Installation

The client installation depends on the device:
- Browser: access through the server root
- Desktop: download from server and install
- Mobile app: download from server (maybe later from play store and apple store)

To get the server up and running you have to install it on a linux system:

    $ npm install -g alinex-admin

After you have done this you may configure....
