# Usage

## User Manual

For normal use you don't need to know anything, everything should be real self explanatory. But I will give some hints here what to know.

__Validation__

Before submitting and also just as you leave a field a basic validity check is fulfilled. It will immediately inform xou just below the field that something is wrong. But as you send it the server will also make a further check which will be displayed in response as a short note at the bottom.

__Authentication and authorization__

For most elements within the system you have to be authenticated by logging in using your email address and password. 

Behind the scene an authorization system will hold all allowed abilities for you and will limit your work to only these. You only be able to see and use the elements you are allowed to.

Documentation for the users will come if the application is ready to be productively used...
