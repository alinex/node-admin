# Server Connection

The client will connect to the REST server using the [FeathersJS Client](https://github.com/feathersjs/client). This is completely integrated into the client app.

It may be used directly or through the state management store described in the next chapter.

The base configuration is done in the `plugins/feathers.js`.
